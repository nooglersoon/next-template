# Modules Folder

The `modules` folder in this Next.js project serves as the repository for organizing different modules or pages of the application. Each module represents a self-contained section of the application, typically with its own unique functionality and UI components.

## Purpose

The primary objective of the `modules` folder is to keep the codebase well-structured and maintainable by grouping related files and components together. Each module is designed to be independent, making it easier to develop, test, and maintain specific parts of the application without affecting others.

## Folder Structure

Inside the `modules` folder, each module follows a consistent structure with the following components:

```
modules/
|-- module_name/
|   |-- index.tsx
|   |-- components/
|   |   |-- Component1.tsx
|   |   |-- Component2.tsx
|   |-- models/
|   |   |-- Model1.ts
|   |   |-- Model2.ts
|   |-- hooks/
|   |   |-- useCustomHook1.ts
|   |   |-- useCustomHook2.ts
```

### 1. `index.tsx`

The `index.tsx` file serves as the root file for the module, representing the main page or entry point for that specific module. It might contain the main component responsible for rendering the module's content and handling its logic.

### 2. `components` folder

The `components` folder contains all custom components that are specific to the module. These components are designed to be reusable within the module but might not be shared across other modules. This folder helps maintain a clear separation of concerns and makes it easier to identify and manage module-specific components.

### 3. `models` folder

The `models` folder contains all custom models, interfaces, or types that are exclusive to the module. These models are designed to describe the data structures used within the module and enhance type safety. Keeping module-specific models within this folder helps prevent naming conflicts and promotes a more organized codebase.

### 4. `hooks` folder

The `hooks` folder contains all custom hooks that support the module's functionality. These hooks are designed to encapsulate reusable logic or state management specific to the module. By centralizing these hooks, we can ensure code consistency and promote code reuse within the module.

## TypeScript Usage

The modules in this folder should be written using TypeScript to leverage its strong typing and compile-time checks. Utilizing TypeScript provides numerous benefits, including improved code quality, better tooling support, and enhanced developer productivity.

## Adding New Modules

When creating a new module, consider the scope and functionality it will encompass. Ensure that the module is independent and can be integrated into the application without conflicting with other modules. Follow the specified folder structure to maintain consistency across modules.

## Testing

Each module, along with its components, models, and hooks, should be thoroughly tested using an appropriate testing framework (e.g., Jest). Write tests that cover various use cases and edge scenarios to verify the module's functionality.

## Contributing

Contributions to the `modules` folder are encouraged. If you have a new module to add or enhancements to existing modules, feel free to submit a pull request. Make sure your changes align with the folder structure and adhere to the project's coding and testing standards.

## License

The contents of the `modules` folder are subject to the project's overall licensing terms, as specified in the project's root directory or explicitly mentioned in each module file. Be sure to review and comply with the licensing conditions before using or modifying any module.
