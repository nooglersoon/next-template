# Common/Layouts Folder

The `common/layouts` folder in this Next.js project serves the purpose of storing all custom layout components that are intended to be used throughout the entire application or in specific modules. These layout components are written in TypeScript, providing type safety and enhancing the development experience.

## Purpose

The primary objective of the `common/layouts` folder is to promote reusability and maintainability by centralizing layout components. These components define the overall structure and design of specific sections of the application, making it easier to maintain a consistent look and feel across different pages and modules.

## Custom Layout Components

All custom layout components residing in this folder should be designed in a way that they can be easily integrated into different pages or modules. They should encapsulate common UI elements, such as header, footer, navigation bars, sidebars, or any other recurring layout patterns.

## TypeScript Integration

Using TypeScript for writing these layout components ensures that the props and data types are well-defined, reducing the risk of runtime errors and enhancing code predictability. By adhering to TypeScript standards, developers can enjoy better code autocompletion and type checking while working with these components.

## How to Use

To utilize a custom layout component from the `common/layouts` folder, follow these steps:

1. **Import the layout component:** Start by importing the desired layout component from the `common/layouts` folder into your target module or page.

2. **Wrap your content:** Enclose the content that you wish to display using the custom layout component with the imported layout component tags.

3. **Pass necessary props:** If the layout component requires any specific props, make sure to provide them as props to the imported component.

4. **Modify or extend the layout component (optional):** If needed, you can extend or modify the layout component to suit the requirements of the specific module or page where it is used. However, be cautious not to violate the fundamental purpose and structure of the original layout component.

## Example

Suppose we have a custom layout component named `MainLayout` that includes a common header and footer. To use it on a specific page, we follow these steps:

```tsx
// Import the MainLayout component from the common/layouts folder
import MainLayout from '@/common/layouts/MainLayout';

const MyPage = () => {
  return (
    // Wrap your content with the MainLayout component
    <MainLayout>
      <div>
        {/* Your page content goes here */}
      </div>
    </MainLayout>
  );
};

export default MyPage;
```
