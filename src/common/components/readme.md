# Common Components Folder

The `common/components` folder in this Next.js project serves as a centralized repository for all custom components that are designed to be reused across various parts of the application. By organizing these components in one location, we ensure maintainability, consistency, and modularity throughout the codebase.

## Purpose

The purpose of the `common/components` folder is to encapsulate commonly used UI elements, widgets, and other functional components that are shared among multiple pages, layouts, or sections within the application. By placing these components in a dedicated folder, developers can easily locate, modify, and extend them without the need to duplicate code or search through different directories.

## Guidelines

When adding new components or modifying existing ones within the `common/components` folder, please adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Reusability**: Ensure that the components added here are genuinely reusable and not tightly coupled to specific pages or contexts. Consider abstracting logic or making props customizable to adapt to different use cases.

2. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Aim to keep each component focused on a single responsibility. Smaller, specialized components are easier to maintain and understand.

3. **Documentation**: Include clear and concise comments within the component code to explain its purpose, usage, and any essential props. Update this README if necessary to provide an overview of new components.

4. **Styling**: Where applicable, prefer using CSS modules or styled-components to encapsulate component styles. Avoid using global styles directly within the components.

5. **Testing**: For complex components or critical functionality, write unit tests to ensure their correctness and prevent regressions.

6. **Version Control**: Always commit changes related to components separately, and ensure descriptive commit messages.

7. **Deprecation and Removal**: If a component is no longer needed or becomes outdated, mark it for deprecation and schedule its removal after a reasonable transition period.

## How to Use

To utilize components from this folder in different parts of the application, follow these steps:

1. **Import**: Import the required component using ES6 import syntax. For example:
   ```javascript
   import { Button, Header, Card } from '@/common/components';
   ```

2. **Usage**: Use the imported component in your JSX code as you would with any other React component. Pass necessary props to customize its behavior or appearance.

3. **Customization**: If you find the need to customize a component's behavior for a specific use case, feel free to extend or create a new variant of the component within the appropriate directory.

## Example

```javascript
// Importing the Button component
import { Button } from '@/common/components';

const HomePage = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to our App</h1>
      <Button label="Click Me" onClick={() => alert('Button clicked!')} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default HomePage;
```

## Contributing

We encourage contributions from all team members to improve the collection of common components. If you have new ideas or improvements, please follow the guidelines above and submit a pull request for review.

Let's work together to build a robust and reusable set of components that enhance the development experience and user experience across the entire application.
