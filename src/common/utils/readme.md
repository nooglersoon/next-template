# Common/Utils Folder

The `common/utils` folder in this Next.js project serves the purpose of organizing utility functions or helpers that are intended to be utilized throughout the application or within specific modules. These utilities are written in TypeScript, which enhances code reliability and readability.

## Purpose

The primary objective of this folder is to store reusable code snippets and functions that perform common tasks, computations, or provide additional functionalities. By centralizing these utilities in one location, we can avoid code duplication and maintain a consistent coding pattern across the application.

## Folder Structure

The folder structure inside `common/utils` may vary based on the requirements and complexity of the application. However, it's generally organized in a manner that groups related utility functions together. Here's an example structure:

```
common/utils/
|-- date/
|   |-- formatDate.ts
|   |-- parseDate.ts
|-- validation/
|   |-- validateEmail.ts
|   |-- validatePassword.ts
|-- ... (other utility categories)
```

## TypeScript Usage

All utility functions within this folder are written in TypeScript, providing type safety and improving the development experience. TypeScript typings enable better code completion, catch type-related errors early during development, and make the codebase more maintainable.

Example usage of a utility function with TypeScript:

```typescript
import { formatDate } from '../common/utils/date';

const date = new Date();
const formattedDate = formatDate(date, 'yyyy-MM-dd');
console.log(formattedDate); // Output: 2023-08-07
```

## Adding New Utilities

When creating new utility functions, ensure that they have a clear purpose and are generic enough to be reused across different parts of the application. If a utility function becomes specific to a particular module, it might be more appropriate to move it closer to that module's folder rather than keeping it in the `common/utils` folder.

## Testing

To ensure the reliability and correctness of utility functions, unit tests should be written for each utility in the appropriate testing framework (e.g., Jest). These tests should cover various use cases and edge scenarios to validate the functions' behavior.

## Contributing

Contributions to the `common/utils` folder are encouraged. If you find yourself writing a new utility that could benefit other parts of the application, consider adding it to this folder for wider reuse.

Please follow the existing folder structure and ensure that your utility functions are thoroughly tested before submitting a pull request.

The contents of the `common/utils` folder are subject to the project's overall licensing terms, as specified in the project's root directory or explicitly mentioned in each utility file. Be sure to review and comply with the licensing conditions before using or modifying any utility function.
