# Common/hooks Folder - Next.js Project

The `common/hooks` folder in this Next.js project serves as a centralized location for storing custom hooks. These hooks are designed to be reusable across different parts of the application or specific modules. The use of TypeScript ensures that the hooks are strongly typed and provide enhanced type safety.

## Purpose

Custom hooks are a powerful feature in React and Next.js applications that allow you to encapsulate logic and stateful behavior in a reusable manner. By organizing these hooks in the `common/hooks` folder, we create a consistent and maintainable structure, making it easier for developers to discover, use, and contribute to the project.

## Usage

To use a custom hook from the `common/hooks` folder in your Next.js application, follow these steps:

1. Import the hook you wish to use into your component or module.

```tsx
import { useCustomHook } from '@/common/hooks/useCustomHook';
```

2. Invoke the custom hook within your component.

```tsx
function MyComponent() {
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useCustomHook();
  // Use the data, isLoading, and error returned by the hook
  // ...
}
```

## TypeScript Support

The custom hooks stored in this folder are implemented with TypeScript support to provide enhanced type checking and improved developer experience. This means that when you use these hooks, your IDE will be able to infer and display the correct types for the hook's return values and arguments.

```tsx
// Example of TypeScript support when using a custom hook
function MyComponent() {
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useCustomHook();
  // TypeScript can infer the types for data, isLoading, and error
  // ...
}
```

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to this project by adding new custom hooks or improving existing ones, consider the following guidelines:

- **Ensure Reusability**: Make sure the hook's logic can be beneficially used in multiple parts of the application or specific modules.

- **TypeScript Typing**: Ensure that the hook is well-typed using TypeScript to provide a clear contract for its users.

- **Documentation**: Document the hook's usage, parameters, return values, and any side effects or dependencies. Update this `README` file if necessary.

- **Testing**: Include appropriate tests to validate the functionality and edge cases of the hook.

- **Folder Structure**: If necessary, create sub-folders inside `common/hooks` to categorize related hooks.

- **Code Quality**: Follow the project's coding standards and best practices.

## Summary

The `common/hooks` folder in this Next.js project is a designated place for storing reusable custom hooks. These hooks are intended to be used throughout the application or in specific modules. The use of TypeScript enhances type safety and provides a better development experience. By adhering to these conventions and guidelines, we create a maintainable and efficient codebase that fosters collaboration and encourages code reuse.
